Power Consumption Test
======================

Theoretical:

* CPU @ 65kHz MSI Range 3: 36.5 uA (29.5 uA sleep)
* LCD @ Range 3: 3 uA
* ADC1 @ Range 3: 3.5 uA
* PWR @ Range 3: 2 uA

Total: 45 uA during conversion, 35.5 uA during sleep

Measured: 160 uA during conversion, 50 uA during sleep (unsure about LCD panel consumption, debugger, and PCB leakage)
